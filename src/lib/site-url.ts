 * The site's canonical origin, for absolute URLs.

 *
 * Vercel exposes the deployment URL, but preview deployments get a different
 * one each time, and a sitemap that points at a preview is worse than none.
 * So the production domain is the default and the env var is the override,
 * not the reverse.
