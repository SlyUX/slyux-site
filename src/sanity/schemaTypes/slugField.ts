/**
 * Shared slug field. Not a registered schema type — a helper that returns a
 * configured field, so every document type gets identical slug rules.
 *
 * Two layers, because one isn't enough:
 *
 *  - `slugify` normalises what the Generate button produces.
 *  - `validation` catches what Generate never sees. Sanity documents that
 *    slugify is skipped when a slug is entered by hand, which is exactly how
 *    an uppercase slug reaches production. Next.js routes are case-sensitive,
 *    so `/creators/Fox-Storytelling` resolving while
 *    `/creators/fox-storytelling` 404s is a real, silent bug.
